IntelliJ Light is a new light theme for IntelliJ-based IDEs starting 2019.3. This plugin is a preview of this theme and can be used with versions 2019.1 and 2019.2.
  
The new light theme features two notable changes:
* A cleaner editor scheme with regular font styles instead of bolds
* A unified theme for Windows, macOS and Linux

The goal of these changes is to make working with the code easier and to provide better UI support on all platforms.

Note that the current light themes for Windows and macOS that mimic the OS look will still be available after the new theme is introduced.
